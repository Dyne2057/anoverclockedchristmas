# anoverclockedchristmas
This repository will be for my code for the An OverClocked Christmas website. I will be redesigning and updating it throughout the year.
This is the code I've used for years. 

Going to breathe new life into this project.  I'm going to do the following:
1. Using either python or PHP, write a script that extracts ID3 metadata from MP3 files and stores that metadata in a JSON or XML file.
2. Using react, vue, or angular, write a frontend that retrieves that data and displays it

This will enable me to update the site more easily using a script to grab ID3 tag info and display it on the correct page.
